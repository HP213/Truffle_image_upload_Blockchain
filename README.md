Now clone the repository and run **npm install package.json**

Make sure install **metamask extension** in chrome browser and make it default. And run the metamask by completing all the formalitites. Go to custom RPC there and add url of local host porovided by ganache on the top, you will automatically get free 100 ethereum!!!!

Now run in terminal run **truffle migrate --reset** and it will confirm you that you are connceted to ganache.

If done, just go and type npm run start and it will take 20-30 seconds to start and automaically open in your default browser.

Just upload the image and make sure **don't forget to open console.**
